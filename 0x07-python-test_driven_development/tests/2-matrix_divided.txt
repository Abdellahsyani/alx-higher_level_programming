How to use 2-matrix_divided.py=
===============================

This module is Divided all elments inside the matrix ``def matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

``matrix_divided(...)`` define a matrix to divide all element by div number and return a new matrix who contains division
integer numbers

::
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
	>>> matrix = [
		[1,2,3],
		[4,5,6]
		]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

::
	>>> matrix = [
                [-1,-2,3],
                [-4,5,-6]
                ]
	[[-0.33, -0.67, 1.0], [-1.33, 1.67, -2.0]]


The function work with floating numbers.
::
	>>> matrix = [
                [1.3,2.5,3.0],
                [4.2,5,6.6]
                ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	
	[[0.43, 0.83, 1.0], [1.4, 1.67, 2.2]]
::
	>>> matrix = [
                [-1.3,-2.5,-3.0],
                [-4.2,-5,-6.6]
                ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	
	[[-0.43, -0.83, -1.0], [-1.4, -1.67, -2.2]]


The matrix with larger value

::
	>>> matrix = [
                [1000,2000,3000],
                [4000,5000,6000]
                ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

	[[333.33, 666.67, 1000.0], [1333.33, 1666.67, 2000.0]]


Matrix with a Single Element

::
        >>> matrix = [
                [23]
                ]
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

	[[7.67]]
